    "- The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support.\n",
    "- RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning, and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.\n",
    "- In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice of routing protocol, as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. \n",
