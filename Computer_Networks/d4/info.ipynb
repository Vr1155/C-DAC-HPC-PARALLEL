    "- Firstly, a DNS packet is sent to DNS server along with the requested URL.\n",
    "- DNS server resolves that URL and send the associated IP address to the client.\n",
    "- Then the client starts a TCP handshake with the Web Server by sending a SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number) packet.\n",
    "- After receiving the SYN packet, server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK packet. \n",
    "- In final part of TCP handshake, client acknowledges the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer through HTTP.\n",
    "- Now the client will send a HTTP request to the server.\n",
    "- Server will respond with a HTTP response which also contains the requested webpage (the landing page is \"index.html\").\n",
    "- Now that all the HTTP requests and responses are done, Client will initiate a request for a \"Graceful TCP connection termination\" by sending a FIN packet to server.\n",
    "- Server will respond by sending a FIN + ACK packet to client.\n",
    "- Client will respond by sending a ACK packet to server. Now the TCP connection is closed.\n",
