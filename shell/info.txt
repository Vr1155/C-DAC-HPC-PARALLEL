Shell scripting in Linux:

	Difference between programming language vs scripting langauge:
		programming lang = compiled
		scripting lang = interpreted.

	What is the point of shell scripting:
		Automation of certain OS-level tasks.

	Shebang line for bash shell script:
	#!/bin/bash

	for giving execute permissions to user:
	$chmod u+x filename.sh

	PATH Environment Variable:
		
		echo $PATH

	Variables in Shell scripting and rules to create it.

	double quotes strings allow variable resolution.

	backquote is different than other single quote strings.
	backquote does command resolution.
	command resolution is also called command substitution.

	read command.

	Shell parameters:

		Command line arguments in shell programs.
		positional parameters in shell scripting.

		eg:
		$set blue green red yellow
		$echo $1
		$echo $2
		$echo $#

	Arithmetic expression:

		An arithmetic expression can be evaluated by $[expression] or $((expression))
		or "expr" command

		For floating point arithmetic operations, we need to use a tool "bc (basic calculator)"

		Available operators: +,-,/,*,%
		
		Task: 
		Accept two numbers as input, perform +,-,/,*,% functions on them and print the output.

	Control structures:

		if then elif then else fi statement.
			conditional statements inside []
		
	Expressions:

		String comparisons:
			= is for comparing (not ==)

		Number comparisons:
			-lt, -le, -gt, -gt, -eq

	Instructor says:
	if you are going to learn from slides, read the code and write your own code without seeing.
	DONT COPY PASTE.

	Logical Operators:
		-a or && = logical AND
		-o or || = logical OR
		! = negation

		
	Case statement.

		case $value in 
			val_1) # code
			val_2) # code
		esac

	while loop

		while [ expression ]
		do
			statements
		done	

	until loop 
		
		until [ negative_expression ]
		do
			statement
		done

	for loop
		
		for var in list
		do
			statements
		done


		eg:

		for num in 1 2 3 4 5
		do
			let "sum=$sum+$num"
		done

	C-like for loops

	Using arrays with loops:
		
		for x in ${arrayname[*]}
		do
			statements
		done

	break and continue:
		
		-> Interupt for, while or until loop
		-> The break statement.
